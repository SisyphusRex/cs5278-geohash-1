# Live Session Overview

This programming assignment will exercise your non-OO Java programming
skills. For those new to Java, this exercise may be very difficult. 

It is OK if this assignment is difficult. Please put in your best effort.

The topics that you will cover in this assignment are:

  1. Recursion
  2. Implementation of an algorithm from a spec
  3. Java arrays
  4. Use of Java system libraries
  
If you don't complete the assignment or your implementation has bugs, you
still need to turn in  your partial / broken implementation to receive
feedback. However, you should make sure that your work compiles. 

For those new to Java, completing the assignment will likely be an iterative
process. You do not need to panic if you can't complete the assignment 
prior to the second live session. There will be time to iterate on your
code and receive a good grade.

Tip: Commit and push to your repository frequently so that the instructor
can see your incremental work. Particularly for people that struggle 
with the assignment, lots of commits will show the effort that you put
in and raise your score. 

Grading process:
   1. If you have a working implementation, you will receive a 100
   2. If you have a broken / incomplete implementation, code comments will
      be inserted into your work with suggestions on what to improve.
   3. If you receive comments, you will need to address the comments
      and commit the updated version within a week of receiving the
      comments.
   4. You may receive multiple rounds of comments.
   5. Once the final version is committed, you will be given a grade.
   
What to do:
   1. See the edu.vanderbilt.cs.live2.GeoHash class for instructions
   2. When your implementation is complete, make sure the most up
      to date version is committed and pushed to your assignment
      repository.
      
Warning! There may be typos, bugs, or other issues with the assignment.
If you encounter a bug, typo, etc., please post to the course discussion
forum to let the instructor know.
